**A two-cent miscellaneous about my background:** Before my undergrad, I was a Mathematics specialized student. However, during my secondary period (grade 6 to 9 in Vietnam), I also spent half of my time learning Social Science (mostly Literature and Geography), before focusing on Mathematics in high school.
