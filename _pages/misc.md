**A two-cent miscellaneous about my background:** Before my undergrad, I was a Mathematics specialized student in high school with multiple (nearly good) experiences in Math competitions, and I view that as one of the main motivations for my theoretical interest in graduate studies. 

However, during my secondary period (grade 6 to 9 in Vietnam), I also spent half of my time learning Social Science (mostly Literature and Geography), before focusing on Mathematics in high school.
